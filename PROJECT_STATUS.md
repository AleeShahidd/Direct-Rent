| User Authentication | 95% | Missing edge case handling |
| Property Management | 90% | Bulk operations incomplete |
| Booking System | 85% | Calendar integration needed |
| Admin Dashboard | 80% | Some reporting features missing |
| ML Integration | 75% | Recommendation engine needs refinement |
| Search & Filtering | 90% | Advanced geospatial search pending |
| Mobile Responsiveness | 85% | Some UI issues on small devices |
| Payment Processing | 60% | Test mode only, not production ready |
| Email Notifications | 75% | Template system incomplete |
| Documentation | 70% | Missing comprehensive API docs |
